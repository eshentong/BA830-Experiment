# Statistical Analysis Project #

For a experimental design class, my team of six created a survey regarding rent price salience to see if a less salience price will lead to higher intent of lease signing. 

Survey takers are randomly assigned to test or control group at the beginning of the survey, to see or take the survey, click [here](https://bostonu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0TKjqpcZSyoYEhU)

Statistical analysis such as ATE, CATE, stats power calculations, OLS, fixed effects, etc were used to measure the statistic significance of the answers gathered.
