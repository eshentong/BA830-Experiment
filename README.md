# Statistical Analysis Project #

For a experimental design class, my team of six created a survey regarding rent price salience to see if a less salience price will lead to higher intent of lease signing.

Statistical analysis such as ATE, CATE, stats power calculations, OLS, fixed effects, etc were used to measure the statistic significance of the answers gathered.
